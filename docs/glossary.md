# CL Glossary

## About

A simple way to collect terms in one place that we use across the project.

This is exclusively for terms that are used in way with distinct or precise
meaning, not shared by an established context. For example, it includes
'channel' and 'account', but not 'utxo'.

Insert a new term in its alphabetic order. Prefer:

- lower case by default although upper case is allowed.
- verbs in their infinitive (without 'to')

In each entry, link the first occurrence of mentioned terms with relative
anchors. Assume that the anchor ref is header with all punctuation and spaces
replaced by single hyphen characters `-`.

## Terms

### account

The value of [channel](#channel) attributed to one of its
[participants](#participant). Typically this is represented by a single integer,
since channels are mono-asset.

### add

A [step](#step) on a [opened](#opened) [channel](#channel) that increases the
value of one of the [accounts](#account). Note that this step does not change
the stage.

### amount

The preferred term for an integer representing an amount of funds. It is
preferred over alternatives such as `value` and `quantity`.

### channel

The fundamental link between two [participants](#participant) in the CL network.
A channel (that [staged](#staged)) consists state on both the L1 and L2. It
includes two accounts, one for each participant.

### cheque

An object exchanged on the L2 and used on the L1 to prove what funds are owed.

There are two types of cheque: normal, and locked. Locked cheques and are valid
(on settling) only if some other conditions are met.

### close

A [step](#step) that changes the [stage](#stage) from [opened](#opened) to
[closed](#closed). It is performed by a [participant](#participant) who wishes
to end the [channel](#channel).

### closed

The second [stage](#stage). It occurs after a [close](#close) step. The
participants are no longer transacting off-chain (at least for long).

### currency

In relation to a [channel](#channel), the asset class which is being exchanged.
The default currency is ada.

### elapse

A [step](#step) that changes the [stage](#stage) from [closed](#closed) to
[elapsed](#elapsed). This is performed by the participant who performed the
[close](#close) step. It can only occur if there has been a sufficient passage
of time since the close. The participant unlocks the funds owed.

### elapsed

A third [stage](#stage) of a [channel](#channel). It is the result of an
[elapse](#elapse) step. The remaining funds belong to other participant.

### end

A [step](#step) that [unstages](#unstage) a [responded](#responded)
[channel](#channel). The participant that performed the [close](#close) unlocks
their funds.

### funds

The preferred term for amount of assets in the channel that are locked as
collateral on the L1. Use the term 'funds' over alternatives such as 'value',
'assets', 'tokens', _etc_.

### L1

Shorthand for layer one ie the Cardano blockchain. It can also be used to refer
to the part of the CL protocol that takes place on the Cardano blockchain, such
as channel utxos and txs that step channels.

### L2

Shorthand for layer two, also called 'off-chain transacting'. Characterised by
simply 'not L1', it includes messages passed between channel partners exchanging
[cheques](#cheque) and [snapshots](#snapshot).

### lifecycle

In relation to a [channel](#channel), it is the series of [steps](#step).

(This term is include mainly to document that the preferred form is as a single
word.)

### normalize

In relation to [cheques](#cheque), it is an [L2](#l2) action that replaces a
locked cheque with a normal cheque. The replacement cheque must share the same
index, and generally shares the same amount.

### open

A [step](#step) that [stages](#staged) [channel](#channel) as [opened](#opened).
The [participant](#participant) performing an open locks their funds and
indicates the credentials of the other participant.

### opened

The main [stage](#stage) of [channel](#channel). While the channel is at this
stage, the [participants](#participant) are transacting off-chain.

### participant

Anyone using the CL network. In relation to a [channel](#channel), there are two
participants.

### partner

In relation to a [channel](#channel), a synonym for [participant](#participant).
This is the preferred term from the bitcoin ecosystem.

### recover

A [step](#step) that [unstages](#unstage) an [elapsed](#elapsed)
[channel](#channel). The participant that did not perform the [close](#close)
recovers their funds.

### respond

A [step](#step) that changes the [stage](#stage) from [closed](#closed) to
[responded](#responded). This is performed by the [participant](#participant) who
did not performed the [close](#close) step. The participant supplies to their
summary of the off-chain transacting to the L1 and unlocks their due funds.

### respond period

The time period after a [close](#close) step during which the [elapse](#elapse) can be
performed. Please note that [respond](#respond) can be afer that deadline as well.

### responded

A third [stage](#stage) of a [channel](#channel). The participant who did not
perform the [close](#close) performs a [respond](#respond) step where the
off-chain summary is provided to the L1. The participant unlocks the funds owed.

### settle

The act of providing the [L2](#l2) state to the [L1](#l1). It occurs in both a
[close](#close) step and a [resolve](#resolve) step.

### signing key

Ed25519 signing key. This is the preferred term over 'secret key' or 'private
key'.

### snapshot

A data object that encapsulates the [L2](#L2) state in a way that can be handled
by the [L1](#L1). It aggregates the amounts exchanged in [cheques](#cheque),
condensing the data required to [settle](#settle).

### stage

A [channel](#channel) stage relates to it's L1 state. A channel (that
[staged](#staged)), begins in a [opened](#opened) then later [steps](#step) to a
[closed](#closed) stage.

### staged

A [channel](#channel) is staged if it there is utxo that represents it on tip.
That is to say, it is staged if there is a utxo at tip representing its current
[stage](#stage). See also [unstaged](#unstaged)

### step

A Cardano transaction that either spends and/or outputs a utxo representing a
[channel](#channel) is said to step the channel.

The term is used both for a specific step, and to mean a "type of step". For
example, we may say:

- "this tx steps this channel" or
- "add is a step"

Steps include: [init](#init), [add](#add), [sub](#sub), [close](#close),
[end](#end)

### sub

A [step](#step) on a [opened](#opened) [channel](#channel) that decreases the

### unstaged

Any terminal [step](#step) ceases the channel. A [channel](#channel) that is no
longer [staged](#staged) is ceased.

### utxo

Our preferred style of shorthand for unspent transaction output.

### verification key

Ed25519 verification key. This is the preferred term over 'public key'.
