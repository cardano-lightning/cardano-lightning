## Actionables

- [ ] @paluh - 2025-09-21-28 - hack every day and report the progress
- [ ] @paluh - 2025-09-28 - finish benchmarking of the `free` steps

## Notes

- paluh switched from stacking steps generators (which become unpractically
  slow) to a single step generators which build the input stage ground up.
- Min-ADA ADR:
  - Konduit has much simpler context solves this without any special handling.
  - We want to upgarde to non-native asset support so CL has to be more
    explicit.
  - Should we use `end` action to release the min-ADA and can only be executed
    by the minADA owner?
  - An extra complexity of the current design is the possible flag switching
    when we transition from Opened to Closed stage.
  - Raneme: min-UTxO to min-ADA.
- F15 rules are rather restrictive so we should push CL to the finish line.
- Cardano Summit trip and CL hackaton planning:
  - We have to book accommodation for the first weekend of November in Berlin.
  - We have to book the second weekend of November in Wroclaw.
  - We have to book the 12th and 13th of November in Berlin.
