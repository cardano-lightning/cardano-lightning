## Notes

- We need for a project pitch deck and more concrete short term vision:
  - Lets' transform F13 proposals into the project roadmap and put it on the
    website.
  - @waalge will prepare a project pitch deck in a form of a presentation.
  - We will include FAQ section on the website as well.
- Software packaging - do not interpret "Cardano Developers Survey" as a good
  source of information (docker is better than system packages). It is developer
  biased and not user biased and we don't know what kind devs supported which
  option.
- @paluh will benchmark possible optimizations of signatories checking in our L1
  implementation.
- We want to be rather serious about transaction signing and key security from
  day one. @waalge will explore and work on the "signing server" in Rust.
- Do we need a "better" logo? Isn't our logo just perfect? ;-)
- Let's meet the next week after Catalyst results are out.
