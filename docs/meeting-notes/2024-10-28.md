## Actionables

- [ ] @waalge - 2024-11-04 - switch to snapshots in the minimal lifecycle adr.
- [ ] @paluh - 2024-11-02 - open a PR to the Article.
- [ ] @paluh - 2024-11-04 - test CBOR encoding on the chain: cost assesment and resulting structure check (compare to other libs - JS, Haskell, Rust).
- [ ] @paluh - 2024-11-04 - open a PR with peer protocol.

## Notes

- BL article - @paluh please focus on the core three points. That article can be refined or split later on (after milestone submission).
- Peer protocol:
    - Define messages using protobuf.
    - CBOR should be constructed by peers (not included in messages) but the spec could contain CDDL of all the signed structures.
    - Focus on single founded channel for now.
- Channel state:
    - Squashes simplify the process, but they can be quite unfair in certain situations.
    - Migrate the spec to double signed `Snapshot`.
    - To keep protocol simple pending HTLCs should be settled as separate utxos (a'la BL).
    - Safety points on L1 based on the `Snapshot`s are desirable but probably part of V2.
- Thread token:
    - We can make some room (~ 12 bytes) in the token name for some metadata.
    - Should we use those spare bytes for something meaningful like gateway tickers? Can we use this source information to build some network statistics?
