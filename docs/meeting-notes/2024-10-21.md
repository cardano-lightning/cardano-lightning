## Notes

### F12 - Milestone 1

#### Acceptance criteria:

    * Blog post on our analysis of bitcoin lightning
    * Architectural Decision Records which will sum up the discussions and conclusions.
    * Spec of the protocol clearly explains the reasoning (some proofs on the paper) behind it which allows to asses correctness.
    * Spec of the protocol includes the API of the smart contract specification.

#### Plan

- ADRs:

  - Add HTLCs
  - Cleanup:
    - thread-token - be more specific what is the final outcome (the shape of
      the token etc.)

- L1 spec:

  - Rewrite the spec in the context of "Minimal Lifecycle" ADR
  - Add HTLCs

- L2 peer protocol

### Lose discussion

- The article + Peer protocol

- "Loop attack" - should not be possible in our case as we have limited number
  of resolutoin iterations

- Peer protocol:

  - Let's do dual funding through `open` + `add` to avoid multi-sig for now
    completely
  - Let's introduce extra step `prep` and new stage `prepped` - this will be a
    separate ADR

- Multisig as a way to achvieve L1 unconditional consensus

- Mututal close approaches:
  - Mutli-sig vs solely redeemer represented consensus
