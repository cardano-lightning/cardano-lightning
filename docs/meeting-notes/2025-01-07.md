- [ ] @paluh - 2025-01-20 - finish cheque serialization testing.
- [ ] @paluh - 2025-01-20 - implement `close` operation.

## Notes

- Waalge is the true Warrior - he delivered the first half of the signing server prototype (storage part) with nice docs.
- Paluh is the true loser - he did not work on the CL during the holidays :-(
- Paluh - Milestone 2 has to be finished by the end of January.
