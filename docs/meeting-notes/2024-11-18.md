## Actionables

- [ ] @paluh - 2024-11-24 - finish the peer protocol and resubmit the milestone

## Notes

- We shortly discussed asymmetricity of the BLN commitment exchange and
  revoke_and_ack message details.

- We agreed on a few peer protocol fixes:

  - Use `Success/Failure` not `Ack/Rej` for simple responses (bumping cheque,
    adding HTLC, fullfiling HTLC etc.).
  - The squashing flow could be:
    - `NewSnapshot` message which uses previous commited partner's Squash.
    - Partner can respond with `SnapshotSigned` or `SnapshotUpdated`.
    - In response to `SnapshotUpdated` we can send `SnapshotSigned` or
      `SnapshotUpdated` again etc.
  - We don't have to precisely specify yet how we derive `ids` for the
    conversations.
  - We can assume message ordering in this version but this can change in the
    future.

- Some other notes:
  - General rule: everything signed (even unconfirmed) is considered as
    committed.
  - Future consideration: instead of squash suggestions (during congestion) we
    should rather renegotiate the channel terms.
