- [ ] @waalge - 2024-11-15 - cosmetics: 404 page setup for the blog
- [ ] @paluh - 2025-11-15 - clean up the Peer Protocol:
  - rename sections/phases to: Initializing, Operating, Retiring
  - introduce more specific "conversations" to the sections
  - use libp2p so we don't have to reinvent the `ping`
  - introduce a bit more synchronicityâ€”regular: `req` -> `res/ack` in most
    cases; sometimes more involved: `squash` -> `snapshot` -> `ack`
  - add diagrams to illustrate the flows
  - refactor `channelId`
  - clean up field names, like `s/xMax/xRange`
  - drop the protobuf for now and add it back at the end of the review
