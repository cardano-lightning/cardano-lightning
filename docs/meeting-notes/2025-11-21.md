## Agenda

- [ ] Review of the last meeting's actionables

## Notes

- Waalge was trying to push more BLN related validation (Bolt11 invoice) to wasm/Rust from JS
- The size of the wasm artifact is crazy big.
- We use wasm-pack (Rust -> Wasm toolchain).
- Binary grows by 1MB after including BLN dependency.

- CL MVPs:
    - Konduit as v0.1
    - Gateway as v0.2:
        - ADA to BLN
        - ADA to ADA
        - Uni directional traffic only
    - Merchant solution as v0.3

- Priorities for the rest of the 2025:
    - Submit the proposals / adjust proposals: Calvus and Stratus.
    - Submit change request to Catalyst so the proposals are not rejected.
    - Working Konduit demo.
    - Catalyst related marketing based on the demo.
    - CL M3.
