## Agenda

<!-- || - [ ] ({{PROPOSER}} -)? {{DESCRIPTION}} -->

- [x] Review of the last meeting's actionables
- Benchmarking in haskell rather than aiken
- Can we reuse this for the tx builders in the node? Maybe, bit janky
- Plantuml introduction
- Walk through the system diagrams
- In depth L2 analysis:
  - Discussion about L2 spec in the MVP context
  - Negotiation is hard without full node operational context - let's introduce
    Watch
  - Separation of L1 and L2 keys and certification which allows reassigment of a
    new L2 keys
  - In depth analysis of all the operations - only normalization requires full
    duplex connection
- Risks at hand:
  - Losing keys - game over, losing snapshot+cheques - funds are at risk, other
    than that funds should be safe.
