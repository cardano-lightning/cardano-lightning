## Actionables

- [ ] @paluh - 2025-09-08 - Fix the spotted bug (`timeout` checking) in the pending cheque reduction function
- [ ] @paluh - 2025-09-08 - Finish the fuzzer for `resolve_responded` and implement `resolve_elapsed`
- [ ] @paluh - 2025-09-08 - Implement `free_closed` and `free_elapsed`.

## Notes

- We started by shortly reviewing the latest ADR which simplifies the cheque structure. We will drop `Normal` cheque completely.
- We were analyzing the min ADA handling:
  - We focused on the pure ADA channels first.
  - @waalge proposed to not introduce any extra mechanism to handle min ADA.
  - We followed that idea and discovered that there are some edge cases which can be handled as follows:
    - We want to introduce some constant to the protocol which will correspond to the min-ADA threshold.
    - In `elapsed` when the `non-closer` is not responsive and his belongings can not cover the min-ADA threshold, `closer` can just end the channel and take all the ADA.
    - In the `responded` case, if the `non-closer` can not take out its belongings because the remaining ADA would be below the threshold, then he can just take out all the ADA.
  - The above should be reviewed carefully and formalized in a form of an ADR.
- We were reviewing and comparing CL vs Konduit pending cheque reduction. We discovered a bug in the CL implementation :-(
