### Things that worked

- The devision of labour looked to be working. The proof would have really been
  in pulling the app together ... so TBC.

- I think the stack choice is mostly working out?

### Things to do better

- However under-ambitious the idea is for the hackathon, its still too
  ambitious.

- Don't use any unfamiliar library or tool. You don't have time time to find out
  if and how it works.

### Takeaways

- I like starting with the (simplest) app. I don't know if we want to re-order
  our milestones. Or just squash the task of the last milestones forward
