Retro: 

Reflections / points of improvement:

- @waalge
    - If we go again: more wasm earlier
    - gui-less client 
- @paluh
    - Happy with tech stack, but js is too weak for customer facing solution.
    - Earlier pipeline for working with and testing wasm
    - On catalyst: try to meet milestones not perfection



### App 

- Finish current flow
- later: move konduit-logic to wasm
- rethink the interfaces with adaptor and state management

### Adaptor

- OpenAPI spec
- Rationalize the sync-ing api.
