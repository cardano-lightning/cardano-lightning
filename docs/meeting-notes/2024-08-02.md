## Meeting agenda:

- Milestones walk through with an attempt to fit the demo into one of them. It does not fit perfectly to the last milestone which includes CLI based POC.
- Short discussion around ADRs - we should not be afraid to create "drafts" (first line of the ADR can be "status: Draft").
- DApp future discussion and effort which should be invested into it.

## Actionable items:

- Spec 0.01 (Dominic).
- Blog 0.01 (at least sketch of the scope) (Tomasz, Nicolas).
- Cleanup prototype and write and publish short hackathon report
