## Actionables

- [ ] @paluh - 2025-08-31 - implement fuzzy tests for `resolve` and `free`.

## Agenda

- [ ] How we approach the F14?

## Notes

- We had a discussion dapps as L2 concept in the context of Marlowe. It sparked some interesting ideas and possibility of collaboration.

- CL vs Cardano Foundation. Are we officially collaborating or not?

- Konduit lacks the concept of a "normal cheque". We should consider dropping it as well from CL.

- BLN uses 32 bytes for the secrets. Our spec uses 64 bytes. We should align on that.
