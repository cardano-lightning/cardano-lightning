## Actionables

- [ ] @paluh - 2025-10-05 - finish all the benchmarking
- [ ] @paluh - 2025-10-05 - create an initial version of the report
- [ ] @waalge - 2025-10-05 - clean up branches in the main repo

## Notes

- How to conclude the benchmarking?
- Should we add full-consensus closing step or rather rely on the `sub` and
  `add`?
- Add `mutual` redeemer which indicates that both parties signed the transaction
  and the channel transition does not require validation.
- Node diversity and Leios digressions
