title: Spec vs BLN pain points
attendees: nhenin, waalge, paluh

## Meeting agenda:

- Known BLN pain points:
  - Heavy setup (BTC node + BLN node)
  - Penalty focused with reserve system
  - Synchronous
- Round over the preliminary spec:
  - Vocabulary around discussion used in the spec - full words up to ~X characters :-P
  - Single Tx channel initialization (Merchant -> Payment Gateway) facilitated by tooling.
  - No need for thread token - any fake UTxO is just a gift. Software should handle that.
  - Improving safety of subs - if the cost is complexity which is hard to default then rethink.
  - Can we clearly separate or layer the design using "Integrity/Safety features" vs "Politness/Efficacy features".
- Customers vs Payment Gateway objectives vs Merchants:
  - Merchant
  - Customer: ease of use (sane defaults), no decissions

## Actionable items:

- Spec 0.01 (Dominic).
- Blog 0.01 (at least sketch of the scope) (Tomasz, Nicolas).
- Add draft for an ADR for thread token vs no thread token channel id representation (Tomasz).
- Cleanup prototype and write and publish short hackathon report (Tomasz).
