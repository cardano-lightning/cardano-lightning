## Notes

Spec:

- Let's use "single thread" and drop the BLN UTxO per HTLC idea.
- Let's harcode the limit of HTLCs to be 20 per channel partner (our rough
  estimate of the locked check CBOR was: list-header:2b + lock:34b +
  amount:10b + timeout:10b ~ 56b)
- We can have a safe (no double satisfaction) batching:
  - iterate over inputs and outputs
  - expect CL inputs and outputs to be on the beginning of these lists
  - expet new channels to be listed as last channel outputs
  - for every channel input expect either none or one or two outputs depending
    on the step executed
- With the above batching on the spending validator level we could:
  - accept redeemer of the shape: `(own_hash, remaining_redeemer)` and decode
    only first element of the tuple
  - use that first value to lookup probably minting policy
  - we can trust the datum because everything will tight at the end by thread
    token as a witness of the full setup (for the extrnal user checking the
    token presence should be enough)
  - we should measure imact of this batching/minting overhead over simple
    spending in diferent contexts
