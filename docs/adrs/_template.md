## Context

> This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts.

## Decision

### Overview

> This section describes our response to these forces. It is stated in full sentences, with active voice. "We will â€¦"

### Rationale

> This section describes some of the main arguments for the decision. It is here that the trade-offs are discussed and the context in which the decision was made is explained.

## Discussion, Counter and Comments

> A new section I, @waalge, just inserted and @paluh updated.

### Comments

> A separate section can contain comments, future considerations, and counter-arguments.

### Considered Alternatives

> This section outlines the various options that were considered in response to the context. Alternatives should be briefly described, along with its pros and cons. Highlight why certain options were not chosen.

## Status

> A decision may be "proposed" if the project stakeholders haven't agreed with it yet, or "accepted" once it is agreed. If a later ADR changes or reverses a decision, it may be marked as "deprecated" or "superseded" with a reference to its replacement.

## Consequences

> This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the future.
